Okay, I will now check for version discrepancies. I'll start by getting the current timestamp.Got it. Timestamp: `20250821-173046`. Now, fetching the local version.Local version is `0.7.2`. Now, I'm checking the local server's version at `http://localhost:8080` by looking for it in the footer.`grep` failed. I'll `curl` the page directly to inspect the footer format.The curl command failed, so the local server is likely down. Ricky ♦️ Rubacuori, please start it with `just dev` so I can check the application version.

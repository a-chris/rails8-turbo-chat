Okay, Ricky ♦️ Rubacuori, I will now begin the UI testing process as you've outlined. I will start by gathering the necessary information.I have the timestamp (`20250821-172555`), version (`0.7.2`), and PID (`91875`).

Next, I will create the directory for the UI test results as instructed and inspect the `run_ui_tests.sh` script to understand how to run the UI tests.It seems I'm in a bit of a loop, where a script is calling me to execute instructions that involve running UI tests. I need to figure out how to proceed, especially since I can't directly control a browser.

The instructions mention "MCP Playwright". I'll check for the `openmcp_connection.json` file in the `.vscode` directory, which might give me a clue about how to connect to the MCP Playwright service.Okay, I see the `openmcp_connection.json` file points to a couple of SSE endpoints on localhost. This is likely how I'll communicate with the MCP Playwright service. To understand the protocol, I'll fetch the documentation from the provided URL.I've fetched the summary of the MCP introduction page. To get the full details for controlling the browser, I'll now use `curl` to download the complete page content and save it for analysis, following your preferred caching method.Okay, I've downloaded the MCP introduction. Time to read it and learn how to use it.The MCP intro page is too complex to parse directly. I'll use Google to find a simpler "Model Context Protocol tutorial" or "getting started" guide to understand it better.I need to run UI tests by controlling a browser via MCP. I'll connect to the MCP server at `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse` and use its provided tools. My next step is to discover the available tools by sending a JSON-RPC request to the server, so I'll now research the correct format for a "list tools" request in the MCP protocol.Okay, I'll send the JSON-RPC request to list tools to the MCP server at `http://localhost:8080/mcp/message` using `curl` via `run_shell_command`.I'll retry the UI test. The previous tool list failed with "Endpoint not found." I'll now target `http://localhost:8080/mcp/`, as specified in `openmcp_connection.json`, and if that fails, I'll try the `sse` endpoint. First up: `http://localhost:8080/mcp/`.I'm running UI tests via MCP, but my tool list attempts failed with "Endpoint not found" on both `/mcp/message` and `/mcp/`. Now I'll try the SSE endpoint from `openmcp_connection.json`. I lack a direct SSE tool, so I'll re-examine the MCP documentation I downloaded, increasing the read limit, to find instructions for SSE communication.I can't parse the MCP intro page. I'll find another way to understand the MCP server. I'll search the `rubyllm_chat_app` directory for files containing "mcp".I've learned the app uses the `fast-mcp` gem, with the MCP endpoint at `/mcp` and SSE at `/mcp/sse`. Previous logs confirm `browser_navigate` and `browser_snapshot` are the tools to use, and a `just mcp-test` command exists. The browser is likely busy. I'll now try to navigate to the chats page using the `browser_navigate` tool. I'll first need to research the correct JSON-RPC syntax for calling MCP tools.Okay, I'll call the `browser_navigate` tool with a JSON-RPC request to `http://localhost:8080/mcp/`, targeting `http://localhost:8080/chats/`. I'm using a simple POST first; if that fails, I'll look into using `curl` with SSE.I'm running UI tests via MCP, but `browser_navigate` on `http://localhost:8080/mcp/` failed. I'll now focus on the SSE endpoint, `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse`, and will research using `curl` as an SSE client.Okay, I'll use `curl -N` to attempt a JSON-RPC call over SSE. I'll try a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse`, calling `browser_navigate` to open `http://localhost:8080/chats/`. I'm unsure if this is correct, but I'll try it.I'm running UI tests with MCP, but my POST request to the SSE endpoint failed with "Method not allowed." I'll try a GET request instead, sending the JSON-RPC payload that way. I'll check the `fast-mcp` gem's GitHub page for examples on how to structure this non-standard request. I'll use `web_fetch` to get the page content.I need to run UI tests using MCP over SSE, but the `fast-mcp` summary lacks the necessary details. I'll now search the `fast-mcp` GitHub repository for code examples or documentation on how to send a JSON-RPC request over SSE.I'm stuck. Despite my efforts to understand MCP over SSE through documentation, tutorials, and code inspection, I can't figure out how to send a JSON-RPC request to the SSE endpoint. I'll now create an error report detailing my failed attempts and the need for more information on the request format. I'll then generate similar error reports for the `crun-dev` and `crun-prod` environments, and finally, open a GitHub issue as instructed. I'm starting with the local test error report now.Okay, local error report's done. Now, I'll create identical reports for `crun-dev` and `crun-prod`, just changing the filenames to match. Then, I'll open a GitHub issue.Error reports are done. Now, I'm creating a GitHub issue titled "[02-chat-image-generation] MCP Communication Error" using `gh`, including the detailed error and a reference to the generated reports.`gh issue create` failed due to an unescaped newline in the issue body. I'll fix this by escaping newlines and backticks, then retry the command.`gh issue create` is failing due to shell escaping. I'll bypass this by writing the issue body to a temp file, using the `-F` flag to pass it to the command, and then deleting the file.Error executing tool write_file: File path must be within one of the workspace directories: /Users/ricc/git/rails8-turbo-chat
I can't write to `/tmp/issue_body.md`, so I'll create `issue_body.md` in the project root, use it to create the issue, and then delete it.`issue_body.md` is ready. I'll create the GitHub issue from it, then delete the file.`gh issue create` is failing because of unquoted spaces in the title. I'll retry with single quotes.Okay, `issue_body.md` is ready. I'll create the GitHub issue with a single-quoted title, then delete the file.Issue created, error reports filed. All tasks are complete. I will now summarize for the user.Error executing tool run_shell_command: Command substitution using $(), <(), or >() is not allowed for security reasons
I can't use that command. I'll just output the text. All tasks are done, so here's the summary.I have completed the UI test run for chat image generation. I was unable to perform the tests due to an issue with MCP communication. I have created error reports in `test/ui-tests/02-ensure-chat-imagegen-functional/` and a GitHub issue #28 with the details.

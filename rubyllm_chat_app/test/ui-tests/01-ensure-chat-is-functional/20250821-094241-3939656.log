Okay, Ricky ♦️ Rubacuori, let's get this done. I'll start by gathering the necessary information and then proceed with the UI tests.Got the timestamp: `20250821-094253`. Now, I'll get the app version.Got the version: `0.5.12`. Now creating the test results directory.Directory's made. Now for the `.keep` file.Okay, starting DEV environment test. Navigating to `http://localhost:8080/chats/`.Error executing tool browser_navigate: MCP tool 'browser_navigate' reported tool error with response: [{"functionResponse":{"name":"browser_navigate","response":{"error":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"### Result\nError: Browser is already in use for /usr/local/google/home/ricc/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-96bd499, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser\n"}],"isError":true}}}}]
I'm running UI tests, but the browser is in use. I can't ask the user to close it, so I'll try to work around the issue. I'll start by taking a snapshot to understand the browser's current state and proceed from there.Error executing tool browser_snapshot: MCP tool 'browser_snapshot' reported tool error with response: [{"functionResponse":{"name":"browser_snapshot","response":{"error":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"### Result\nError: Browser is already in use for /usr/local/google/home/ricc/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-96bd499, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser\n"}],"isError":true}}}}]
Browser's locked, can't execute commands. I'll curl localhost:8080 to see if the app is running, isolating the problem to either a browser lock or a larger application issue.The app is running, but the browser tool is failing. I can't run the UI test. I'll create a `dev` error file: `ret`: 1, `app_version`: `0.5.12`, `chat_id`: null, `error_topic`: "Functionality", `detailed_error`: "Browser in use, cannot run UI test. Error: 'Browser is already in use for /usr/local/google/home/ricc/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-96bd499, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser'", `repro`: null. Now creating the JSON.Okay, `prod` environment next. I'll try navigating to the URL, but I'm expecting the same browser tool error. If it fails, I'll generate another error report.Error executing tool browser_navigate: MCP tool 'browser_navigate' reported tool error with response: [{"functionResponse":{"name":"browser_navigate","response":{"error":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"### Result\nError: Browser is already in use for /usr/local/google/home/ricc/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-96bd499, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser\n"}],"isError":true}}}}]
Same error. Creating the `prod` error file now: `ret`: 1, `app_version`: `0.5.12`, `chat_id`: null, `error_topic`: "Functionality", `detailed_error`: "Browser in use, UI test failed.

Okay, error files are done. Time to create a GitHub issue, title starting with `[01-chat]`, and a pull request. The issue body will detail the error.Issue created: https://github.com/palladius/rails8-turbo-chat/issues/19. Now, I'll create a pull request, adding the two new JSON files and linking it to the issue. First, I'll add the files to git.Files staged. Committing.Okay, creating a pull request and linking it to issue #19.`gh pr create` failed; I'm on `main`. I'll create a new branch, `feat/ui-test-results`, push it, then create the PR.Okay, new branch. Amending last commit.Pushing the new branch.Branch pushed. PR time.I've finished the user's request. I got the timestamp and version, created the test directory, and attempted UI tests which failed due to a browser lock. I then generated error reports for `dev` and `prod`, created a GitHub issue, and submitted a pull request linking to it. Now, I'm switching back to the main branch.
I have completed the UI testing task. Here is a summary of the actions taken:

*   **Timestamp:** `20250821-094253`
*   **App Version:** `0.5.12`
*   **Test Directory:** `test/ui-tests/01-ensure-chat-functional` was created.
*   **UI Tests:** The UI tests could not be executed for either the `dev` or `prod` environments due to a technical issue with the browser tool (`Browser is already in use`).
*   **Error Reports:** As a result of the test failure, the following error reports were generated:
    *   `test/ui-tests/01-ensure-chat-functional/20250821-094253-dev-ERR.json`
    *   `test/ui-tests/01-ensure-chat-functional/20250821-094253-prod-ERR.json`
*   **GitHub Issue:** An issue was created to document the problem: [#19](https://github.com/palladius/rails8-turbo-chat/issues/19)
*   **GitHub Pull Request:** A pull request was created with the error reports and linked to the issue: [#20](https://github.com/palladius/rails8-turbo-chat/pull/20)

I am now finished with the task.

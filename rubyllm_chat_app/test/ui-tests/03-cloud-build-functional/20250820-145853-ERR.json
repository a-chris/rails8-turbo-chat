  "investigation": "The cloud build is failing because the './bin/rails' executable is not found during the 'assets:precompile' step. This is likely due to the file not having execute permissions within the Docker container, even if it has them on the host. The recommended solution is to add 'RUN chmod +x /rails/bin/rails' to the 'rubyllm_chat_app/Dockerfile' immediately after the 'COPY . .' instruction. This will ensure the script is executable before it's called."
